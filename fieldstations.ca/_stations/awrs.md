The AWRS is a 4-season facility that facilitates field research & education in Algonquin Provincial Park. For 70 years
the AWRS has provided accommodations, meals and lab space to researchers and educators interested in the diverse flora
and fauna of the area. The AWRS maintains a 80 sq km research reserve encompassing dozens of lakes, rivers and streams
that provide habitat to many threatened species. This unique setting hosts many long term (50+ yr) research projects on
the life-history, ecology and behaviour of the reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals of Algonquin.
