The centre is located on the banks of the Quesnel River near the community of Likely. It was originally established in
the 1980s as a DFO salmon hatchery, but closed in this role in 1995. The facility was made available to UNBC as a field
station to focus on research in landscape ecology. Faculty and students from UNBC and other institutions, and staff from
federal and provincial agencies, are active at the QRRC in a wide range of research, including fluvial geomorphology and
sedimentology, limnology, hydrology and climatology. The centre has also hosted fisheries scientists, foresters,
biologists, geologists and ecologists.
