The Koffler Scientific Reserve at Jokers Hill (KSR) is located on the Oak Ridges Moraine just north of Canada's largest
city, Toronto. Its 350 hectares span a mosaic of wetlands and forests, including Ontario's largest remaining stand of
old-growth hardwood. KSR is internationally recognized for fostering cutting-edge research and education in
biodiversity, ecology and conservation biology.
