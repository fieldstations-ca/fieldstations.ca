The Western Arctic Research Center (WARC), part of the research division of Aurora College, is located in Inuvik,
Northwest Territories. WARC operates year-round and can provide researchers office space, access to a research library,
high-speed and wireless internet, laboratory space and equipment, accommodations, and highly skilled research technician
support. In addition, the facility is equipped with storage and freezer facilities and can provide field equipment to
researchers. Research and monitoring services can also be provided on a contractual basis, and hiring of local research
assistants can be facilitated.  Our technicians regularly travel to field sites to take samples, and to monitoring sites
to download data, maintain equipment, and perform site inspections.
