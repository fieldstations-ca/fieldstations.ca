The Arctic Institute of North America (AINA), Univ. Calgary, is home to the Kluane Lake Research Station (KLRS). AINA
was created in 1945 to advance studies of the circumpolar Arctic through the natural & social sciences. KLRS is key to
this and for > 50 years has been one of the busiest field stations in northern Canada. Located in SW Yukon, KLRS
provides an entry to the Icefield Ranges of the St. Elias Mtns, Canada's highest mountains & largest glaciers. The
elevation difference (>5000 m) between Kluane Lake and the crest of the St. Elias Mtns. provides a strong environmental
gradient and diverse & unique research opportunities.
