The CEN Clearwater Lake Research Station is legally owned by the Kativik Regional Government (KRG), but is operated by
the Centre d’études nordiques. Clearwater Lake is the second largest natural lake of the province of Québec (2243 km2).
It sits at an altitude of 240 m, the limit reached by the postglacial sea, and drains into Hudson Bay via Clearwater
River (Rivière à l’ Eau-Claire) with a maximum outflow rate of 150 m3/s.
