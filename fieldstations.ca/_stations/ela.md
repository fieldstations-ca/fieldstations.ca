The Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA) is a freshwater research facility in northwestern Ontario, Canada, comprised of
58 small lakes and their watersheds. Founded in 1968, it is one of the only places in the world where researchers can
conduct whole-ecosystem experiments, manipulating lakes to study how all aspects of the ecosystem - from the atmosphere
to fish populations - respond. IISD-ELA welcomes collaborations to build capacity for freshwater science and policy
action in Canada and around the world.
