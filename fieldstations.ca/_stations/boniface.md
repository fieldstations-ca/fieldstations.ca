The Boniface River Research Station is situated within the forest tundra less than 10 km from the tree limit and some 50
km inland from Hudson Bay. The landscape around the station is composed of both wooded hills (30 %) and hills dominated
by tundra vegetation (70 %). The most protected sites are generally forested except for areas that have been affected by
fire which induced an opening in the forest cover. Landscape features of scientific interest are discontinuous
permafrost, eskers, thermokarst ponds, palsas, the Boniface River, vegetation and the treeline.
