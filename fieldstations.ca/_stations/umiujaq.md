The Umiujaq Research Station is owned and run by the Centre d’études nordiques in the village of Umiujaq (400-500
inhabitants), situated on the eastern shores of the Hudson Bay in Nunavik, Québec, Canada. It is located next to a pier
for easy maritime access. The village is located 15 km north of Richmond Gulf (Lac Guillaume-Delisle), an immense inland
bay connected to the Hudson Bay via a rocky gulch resembling a canyon.
