The station is in the centre of the village of Radisson, surrounded by the eastern Canadian Shield taiga with Boreal
dominated by black spruce and grey pine. Current research focusses on forest dynamics at the limit between boreal and
subarctic environments in relation to natural disturbances and climate change; ecology of boreal conifers; influence of
large northern water bodies and variations in water levels; tree ring analysis of past hydro-climatological variations;
recent dynamics of peatlands and impacts of climate change.
