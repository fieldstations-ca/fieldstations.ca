The Salluit Research Station is located in the Inuit community of Salluit, Nunavik, Québec, Canada. Salluit is found in
the low Arctic tundra in the continuous permafrost zone, surrounded by rocky plateaus and a hilly topography. Research
in both natural & human sciences has been done here since the 1960s. Permafrost research by the CEN began in 1987;
Salluit is an important site for long-term permafrost and climate change research.
