The BGS Institute facilitates leading-edge research and experiential learning of biological diversity and the ecosystem
processes that support it in the Canadian Rockies and environs. The Institute resulted from the merger of two research
entities: the Kananaskis Field Stations and the G8 Legacy Chair in Wildlife Ecology. The BGS Institute consists of two
field stations. The Barrier Lake Station (built 1967), located in the Kananakis Valley 80 km west of Calgary, and the
R.B. Miller Station (founded 1950), located in the Sheep River Provincial Park 110 km sw of Calgary. The field stations
support researchers, courses, and conferences from both Canadian and international institutions.
