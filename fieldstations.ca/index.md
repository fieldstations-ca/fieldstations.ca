Field stations serve many important functions: 1. Facilitating research in fields spanning ecology through
biogeochemistry, 2. Supporting undergrad & grad education, inspiring future generations of scientists and
decision-makers, 3. Enriching science & environmental outreach to schools and public, 4. Engaging in
biodiversity conservation, and 5. Functioning as sentinels of effects of human-caused environmental change.
