title: The Importance of Field Stations
permalink: /importance/
---

Field stations vary in mandate, governance, institutional affiliation, size, and geographic and
environmental context. With such marked diversity it is challenging to encapsulate the value of individual
field stations within a single document. Nevertheless, it is easy to capture the collective value of field
stations to science and society as they provide:

* Venues for intensive field courses and teaching workshops using both “natural laboratories” and state-of-the-art 
  instrumentation (e.g. climate monitoring instrumentation, telemetry, eddy flux covariance towers).
* Locales for sustained and leading-edge research in ecology and evolutionary biology, physiology,
  environmental studies, civil engineering, geography, geology, and myriad other disciplines with secure
  and predictable research environments.
* Repositories of long-term datasets that (i) facilitate comparisons of populations and ecosystems over
  time, (ii) allow tracking of temporal environmental change, and (iii) provide inspiration, data or specimens for new 
  studies.
* Locales where researchers from multiple disciplines, institutions and cultures will meet, exchange
  ideas, and often serendipitously arrive at new ways of thinking or lines of research.
* Conservation of biological, landscape and cultural diversity.
* Pristine, 'undisturbed' reference sites for large-scale studies of human impacts.
* Opportunities for school and public outreach in science, natural history, outdoor education, and environmental and 
  conservation issues.
